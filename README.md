Together, these datasets enable a comprehensive analysis of purchasing patterns and product success, supporting strategic decisions to boost business growth and improve customer retention.
### Project Objectives
This project leverages the Sales Data and Customer Data to achieve the following
objectives:
1. Sales Performance Analysis: Evaluate sales trends across regions and products to identify growth opportunities.
2. Customer Behavior and Loyalty: Understand customer demographics, subscription preferences, and retention rates to enhance engagement strategies
3. Business Trends: Derive insights from combined sales and customer data to guide data-driven business strategies and increase customer lifetime value
### Sales Data Objectives
The Sales Data dataset provides detailed information on individual transactions, supporting the following goals:
1. Evaluate Product Performance: Identify top and low-performing products in various regions. This helps pinpoint which products are revenue drivers and which may need promotional support or possible discontinuation.
2. Understand Regional Sales Patterns: Analyze sales differences by region to inform targeted marketing and product distribution efforts, aligning offerings with regional preferences.
3. Identify Seasonal Sales Trends: Discover sales peaks and declines during specific times of the year, allowing for optimized promotion schedules and inventory planning.
4.Calculate Key Revenue Metrics: Review metrics such as total sales, average order size, and overall revenue to assess business performance and identify main revenue sources.
### Customer Data Objectives
The Customer Data dataset offers insights into customer profiles and subscription details, enabling the following objectives:
1. Assess Customer Loyalty and Retention: Examine subscription lengths and cancellation rates to gain insights into loyalty and develop strategies for retaining at-risk customers.
2. Differentiate by Subscription Type: Compare customer behaviors and revenue across subscription levels (e.g., Basic, Premium) to tailor marketing efforts and enhance upselling strategies.
3. Evaluate Revenue per Customer: Measure individual contributions to total revenue, identifying high-value customers and opportunities to grow lower-value segments.
4. Map Regional Customer Distribution: Analyze customer locations to understand regional reach and guide expansion or localized marketing plans.

### Key Metrics for the Sales Data
The Sales Data dataset provides transaction-level details, allowing us to track important sales and revenue metrics.
- Total Revenue: Sum of all sales across all orders. This metric helps gauge overall business income and track revenue growth over time.
- Average Order Value (AOV): Total revenue divided by the number of orders. AOV helps assess the average amount customers spend per transaction, which is useful for measuring customer purchasing power.
- Product Sales Volume: The total number of units sold for each product. This metric shows which products are most popular and which may need more promotion.
- Sales by Region: Total sales and units sold per region. Analyzing sales by region helps us understand geographic trends and allows for region-specific marketing or inventory adjustments.
- Sales Over Time: Monthly or quarterly sales trends. Tracking sales over time reveals seasonal patterns or growth trends that can inform marketing and inventory decisions.
 ### Key Metrics for Customer Order
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Total revenue generated by each customer over their subscription duration. Identifies high-value customers and supports loyalty efforts.
- Cancellation Rate*: Percentage of customers who cancel their subscription within a set period. Measures customer retention and informs strategies to reduce cancellations.
- Subscription Duration*: Average length of time customers stay subscribed. Indicates customer loyalty and the effectiveness of subscription plans.
- Revenue by Subscription Type: Total revenue from each subscription tier (e.g., Basic, Premium). Shows the financial impact of each plan and informs pricing or upselling strategies.
- Customer Demographics by Region: Number of customers and revenue contribution by region. Highlights active customer bases and supports regional marketing decisions.
